Last time we talked about the basics of recursion. For this lesson we will just do more examples.
So there is no new content to learn here.
"""

# Question 1
# Write a recursive function to output a list of all the three digit numbers you can make with the numbers
# 1, 2 and 3. Repeat numbers are allowed.

# Question 2
# Write a recursive function to output a list of all the four digit numbers you can make with the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.
# Repeat numbers are NOT allowed so 112 and 111 is not allowed.

# Question 3
# Write a recursive function that returns the largest number from a given multidimensional list of numbers

# Question 4
# Write a recursive function that takes a single dimension list and returns the reverse of that list.
# Note: this can be easily done in one line normally but we are practicing recursion

# Question 5
# Write a recursive function that finds the sum of all the digits of a given whole number. Return the sum.

# Question 5
Describes the difference between using a recursive solution or a iterative solution to solve a problem. Which is better? Can there be any issues with a recursive solution?

Ensure you have a Github account before continuing.
The following is an exercise to help you get familiar with using Git.
In class we already talked about what Github is and how to use it so
this exercise should be quite easy.

Question 1
Explain in your own words what Git is and how it can be useful.

Question 2
Explain what a repository is. How do you create a repository.

Question 3
If there is a specific file or file types that you want Git to ignore what can you do?

Question 4
When you do "git status" in your repo you see hello.txt, yo.txt and world.js
If you wanted Git to ignore the hello.txt file and all .js files what will you do?

Question 5
What can happen when you have multiple people working on the same file at the same time?
What is one way you can avoid this?

Question 6
Create a new repository under you Github account called "Summer Project 2019". You can do this
directly on the Github website. Now clone the repository and in the repo create a new python file.
In the python file simply write "print("Hello World")" and save. Now commit the new file and push
your changes. Go back to the Github website and verify that the python file you pushed is present.

Question 7
If your friend made changes to the repo and you want to update your local copy to reflect the
changes what git command(s) can use you in order to do so.


Note: There is a lot more to Git then this and you will learn in more detail as you progress
in your career. For now this is all you need to know

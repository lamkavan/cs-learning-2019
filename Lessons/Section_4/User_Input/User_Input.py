# One really important concept in programming is being able to get user input

# Lets do a ex
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello", name)

# One thing you need to know is that input always returns a string

# If you want to ask for a age and store it as an int then you must convert it into a int.

# If the user just presses return or enter then the empty string is returned ie/ ""

"""
In this section we talk about taking strings and doing interesting things
with them. Also, we practice working with strings in general since strings
are used a lot. A lot of string manipulation question such as reversing a string
may be easily done using string methods that are provided to us. However, there
are some problems that can't be solved via these methods. Furthermore, it is good
practice to be able to solve problems without having to depend on these methods
as some programming languages do not have these methods and often time you
will not be allowed to use them during tests/exams.

# Lets begin by learning what a palindrome is and how to detect it
# A palindrome is a word that is the same spelled forward and backwards ie/ racecar and madam
# We will write a function for this.
def is_palindrome(str1):
    ### DO THIS IN CLASS
    pass


# Now lets write a function to print out an inverted star triangle given a height parameter
def print_inverted_star_triangle(height):
    ### DO THIS IS CLASS
    pass


# So far that was easy lets do something more intense...
# Write a function that takes a sentence and returns a list of all the words in the sentence
# without the punctuation
def get_words_from_sentence(sentence):
    ### DO THIS IN CLASS
    ### To remove the punctuation you could pre-made function but we take hard way
    ### Learn esc chr
    punctuation = [".", ",", "\"", "'", ":", ";", "!", "?", "$", "@", "%", "#"]
    pass


# Lets solve another problem
# Write a function that implements the split function
def my_split(str1, delimeter):
    ### DO THIS IS IN CLASS
    pass


# Finally we write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a single big string
# with the letters from the list of words such that all the "a" are replaced with 1 and all
# "b" are replaced with 2. All other letters are capitalized. We go through the list from left to right
def get_mashup_string(list_of_strings):
    ### Do this is class
    ### show += shortcut here
    pass

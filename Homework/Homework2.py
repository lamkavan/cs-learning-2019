"""
Please Answer the following question to the best of your abilities.
If you want to search things up go ahead but copying and pasting
a solution is not allowed. You can even search up a solution if you
are really stuck but make sure you understand it and try to rewrite the
code instead of just copying and pasting.
Note: You must write docstring for your functions unless I say in the question that you don't have to

Question 1
Given two strings as input return a string with the characters from the two strings, but ensure the characters are
interchanged with each other. For example, if the input strings are "cat" and "dogy" then the return string
should be “cdaotgy”. Note you are NOT allowed to use any string methods for this question.


Question 2
Write a function that takes in one string and returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise.
You are NOT allowed to use any string methods for this question. If the function get an empty string as input
then we should return False.


Question 3
Write a function that takes in one word (str) and prints to the console the number of vowels and consonants in the word.
The vowels are a,e,i,o and u. You can NOT use any string methods.


Question 4
Write a function that takes a single string as input and returns the same string but with every other character capitalized.
Start by capitalizing the first character.


Question 5
Write a function that takes in three strings labeled str1, str2 and str3. The function will find all occurrences of
str2 in str1 going from left to right and replace it with str3 then return the final string. For example if the input
strings are hellollo, lo and bob then the return string is “helboblbob”.


Question 6
Write a function that takes in one string and prints to the console the same string but without any white spaces.
For example if the input string is “hello world I am the best” then the function should print “helloworldIamthebest” to
the console. Do NOT use any string methods. There is already a string method that can do this but you are not allowed
to use it.


Question 7
Write a function that prints to the console a star triangle given a height parameter.
For example, if the height parameter is 5 then the function should print the following to the console...
*
**
***
****
*****


Question 8
Write a function that takes in a word (str) and prints to the console all the characters that occurred more than once
and the number of times the character appears in the string. Note that ordering does not matter and you are NOT
allowed to use string methods. You can still use dict, list, int and float methods though if you like.


Question 9
What are two difference between a list and a tuple?


Question 10
What are some methods for tuples? What do you notice?


Question 11
When can tuples be useful? Give an example of when tuples are better than list.


Question 12
Does aliasing happen with tuples?


NOTE: For all the questions below you DO NOT write docstrings. These are challenge questions. Solutions are not given.
Question 13
Write a function that takes an int called num_tries as input. The function will ask the user to enter a name
which obviously can only contain letters and not numbers or punctuation. The function will
keep on asking for a name until the user enters a proper name. If the user enters a valid name
then return True. If the user takes more than num_tries then stop asking for a name and return False.


Question 14
Write a function that takes in a dictionary as input and remaps the keys in reverse order.
Confused right? Let me give you an example. If the input dict is {"dog" : 12, "cat" : 8, 15 : ["hello"], 1 : "yo"}
then the output dict should be {1 : 12, 15 : 8, "cat" : ["hello"], "dog" : "yo"}. Note that the order of the key-value
pairs in the return dict does not matter. As long as 1 is mapped to 12, 15 to 8, "cat" to ["hello"] and so on.


Question 15
Write a function that takes in a string which represents a code. The function will return True if the code is valid
and False otherwise. A code is valid if it starts with a capital letter and is followed by 5 digits. No punctuation or
spaces can appear in the code. If the leading capital letter is an "A" or "B" then the 5 digits after must added up to
larger than 13 and also the digits must appear in increasing order (ie/ From left to right the 5 digits 15779 is
increasing, but 57910 is not). If the first letter is not an "A" or "B" then the 5 digits after only have to add up to
less than or equal to 23.


Question 17
Get off you computer and go outside. It is summer go have fun.

"""
Please Answer the following question to the best of your abilities.
If you want to search things up go ahead but copying and pasting
a solution is not allowed. You can even search up a solution if you
are really stuck but make sure you understand it and rewrite the
code instead of just copying and pasting.

NOTE: For all the questions below you must proper comment your code
and this includes writing docstrings for functions, methods and classes.
However, the questions below do not involve methods and classes so really\
you need docstrings for functions only.

Question 1
Write a function that takes in a number (could be an int or float) and returns
the number of digits the number has. Remember that a decimal point does not count as
a digit.


Question 2
Write a function that takes a string as input and outputs to the console each character on
separate lines but with each character repeated 3 times. For example, if the input string is cat
then the output should look like the following...
c c c
a a a
t t t


Question 3
Write a function that takes in a list of ints and returns the same list but with all of the
ints turned into strings.


Question 4
Is it always possible to convert a string to an int? What about an int to a string? What about a string to a list.
You can do some investigating if you don't know the answer


Question 5
Explain what aliasing is and also give your own example. Does aliasing occur with ints? Why or why not.


Questions 6
Explain what range does. Experiment with range and explain what range(1,10) is doing. Feel free to look this up.
I ask this because we only covered stuff like range(5) in class but I never did range with two parameters.
Also, explain range(1,10,2). What does the third parameter do?

Question 7
Ok ok I know you want to enjoy your summer break no more questions....

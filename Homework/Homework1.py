Please Answer the following question to the best of your abilities.
If you want to search things up go ahead but copying and pasting
a solution is not allowed. You can even search up a solution if you
are really stuck but make sure you understand it and try to rewrite the
code instead of just copying and pasting.

Question 1
Given a list of strings return a string with the characters from the strings in the list but ensure the characters are
interchanged with each other. For example, if the list is [“cat”, “dog”, “yp”] then the return string should be “cdyaoptg”


Question 2
Write a function that takes in two strings and returns true if the strings are palindromes and false otherwise


Question 3
Write a function that takes in one string and prints to the console the number of vowels and constants in the word


Question 4
Write a function that takes a single string as input and returns the same string but with every other character capitalized.
Start by capitalizing the first character.


Question 5
Write a function that takes in three strings labeled str1, str2 and str3. The function will find all occurrences of
str2 in str1 and replace it with str3 then return the final string. For example if the input strings are
hellollo, lo and bob then the return string is “helboblbob”. You are not allowed to use any string methods.


Question 6

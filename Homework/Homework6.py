"""
This homework will test your understanding of basic sorting anf searching algorithms
discussed in class. The algorithms covered are bubble sort, insertion sort, linear search and binary search.
You are expected to fully understand these algorithms.
"""


# Question 1
"""
Given this list of numbers [2,5,1,4,3,7,10,0]
show the intermediate states of the list as insertion sort runs on it. We did an
example of this in class.
Also, show the intermediate states of the list when bubble sort runs on the list.
An intermediate state is the order of the numbers in the list after one main iteration of
the respective algorithm. Note: assume we are sorting from least to greatest.
"""


# Question 2
"""
Is it always possible to use insertion sort on a list of numbers to sort it? Are there any restrictions on insertion
sort?
"""


# Question 3 (a harder question)
"""
Taking a look back at the bubble sort code seen in class what can we do to improve the efficiency of the program.
Hint: If bubble sort completes one iteration without making any swaps what does that mean?
"""


# Question 4
"""
Will linear search work in all cases or is there a case where it will not work? What about binary search?
"""


# Question 5
"""
In class we talked about binary search. I want you to implement it below. I have already provided the header.
You should assume that list_of_nums is sorted from GREATEST to LEAST. Make sure you test your code after.
"""
def binary_search(list_of_nums, target_num):
    pass


# Question 6 (a harder question)
"""
Research time!!
Go look up selection sort and learn the algorithm on your own. This one is easy to understand which is 
why I leave it up to the student. Once you did your research explain the algorithm and write the code for it
below. The header is provided. Also explain if this algorithm is better than insertion sort or not. Are there cases
where insertion sort will do a better job?

#Question 1
#num= input("Enter a number: ")
#if "." in num:
    #new_num = num.replace(".", '')
#else:
    #num_of_digits = len(new_num)
    #print(num_of_digits)



#Question 2
#word= input("Enter a word: ")
#new_word= word.replace("", " ")
#print(new_word)
#print (new_word)
#print(new_word)


#Question 3
#a= input("enter some numbers: ")
#empty= []
#new= empty.append(a)
#print(new)


#Question 4
#to convert something into a list you can .append it and add it into an empty list
#to convert something into a str put brackets around the variable and add str()
#to convert something into an int put brackets around the variable and add int()


#Question 5
#Aliasing is re-naming an immutable type, inorder to change it. Since the data type cant be regularly chnanged
#because of its immutable properties, it has to be recalled and chnaged.
#Aliasing does not occur with ints because they are mutable


#Question 6
#Range with 2 parameters (1,10) will return all numbers from 1 to 9 but will exclude 10.
#Range with 3 parameters (1,10,2) will return all numbers from 1 to 9 but going up by 2's

Comments:
--- For the love of god why you do this to me? Do not put your actual code in comments. Otherwise you
will not be able to run the code. Only put the sentence answers in comments.
--- Ensure you label at the top of the file the title, name and data (I forgot to tell you this sorry).
You can see I added it for you.
--- Also make sure you add at least two empty lines between your questions to reduce clutter
--- Ok... did you check the solutions? You need to write functions. Like for question 1 you are not
supposed to get input from the user.
--- Question 1 : Ok but if a float is entered you don't actually tell the user the number of digits.
It only works for ints.
--- Question 2 : is totally wrong
--- Question 3 : what?
--- Question 4 : You did not even answer the question...
--- Question 5 : Check the solutions. You have the ideas switched around.
--- Question 6 : Correct!
